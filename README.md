# Enfyra Backend

[Enfyra](https://demo.enfyra.io/login) is the open-source backend platform.  
Weâ€™re building the flexibility backend framework that automatically generates APIs from your database. You create tables through a visual interface, and Enfyra instantly provides REST & GraphQL APIs for them - no coding required. It's like having a backend developer that never sleeps.
